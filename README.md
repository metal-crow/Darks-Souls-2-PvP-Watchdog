Darks-Souls-2-PvP-Watchdog
==========================

Will allow people playing dark souls 2 to exclude a person they have matched up with, and not connect with them again.


HOW TO USE
==========================
Run this program by right clicking run.bat and RUNNING IT AS ADMINISTRATOR after you open Dark Souls 2.

Currently, this program can only be run on Windows, because i rely on windows firewall and cmd to get processes.


INFO
==========================
Requires the Winpcap driver for windows to be installed. http://www.winpcap.org/default.htm
Written using the jNetPcap java wrapper library.


Currently very much an alpha.
Also, i have no clue how to use jNetPcap, so this will probably look awful if you do.
