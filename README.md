Darks-Souls-2-PvP-Watchdog
==========================

Will allow people playing dark souls 2 to exclude a person they have matched up with, and not connect with them again.
Run this program anytime you want, you dont have to run it after you've opened Dark Souls 2.


Required the Winpcap driver (for windows).
Written using the jNetPcap java wrapper library.

Currently very much a beta.
Also, i have no clue how to use jNetPcap, so this will probably look awful if you do.
