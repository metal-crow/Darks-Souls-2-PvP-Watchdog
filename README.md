Darks-Souls-2-PvP-Watchdog
==========================

Will allow people playing dark souls 2 to exclude a person they have matched up with, and not connect with them again.

Required the Winpcap driver (for windows) or the libpcap driver for linux.
Written using the jNetPcap java wrapper library.

Currently very much a beta.
