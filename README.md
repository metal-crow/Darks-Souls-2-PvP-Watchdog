Darks-Souls-2-PvP-Watchdog
==========================

Will allow people playing dark souls 2 to exclude a person they have matched up with, and not connect with them again.


Well, after weeks of work i have determined that Dark souls 2 will fall back to a dedicated server connection w/ valve's
server if p2p fails. Unless I'm mistaken about this discovery, this renders this program obsolete, as blocking users 
is now impossible. God help us all.
HOwever, this tool CAN be used to force dedicated servers, so maybe that helps with lag? I dont know.


HOW TO USE
==========================
Run this program by right clicking run.bat and RUNNING IT AS ADMINISTRATOR after you open Dark Souls 2.

Currently, this program can only be run on Windows, because i rely on windows firewall and cmd to get processes.


INFO
==========================
Requires the Winpcap driver for windows to be installed. http://www.winpcap.org/default.htm
Written using the jNetPcap java wrapper library.


Currently very much an alpha.
Also, i have no clue how to use jNetPcap, so this will probably look awful if you do.
