Darks-Souls-2-PvP-Watchdog
==========================

Will allow people playing dark souls 2 to exclude a person they have matched up with, and not connect with them again.
Run this program anytime you want, you dont NEED to run it any particular time before/after you've opened Dark Souls 2. I just recommend running it before you open Dks2.


Requires the Winpcap driver for windows to be installed. http://www.winpcap.org/default.htm
Written using the jNetPcap java wrapper library.

Currently very much a beta.
Also, i have no clue how to use jNetPcap, so this will probably look awful if you do.
